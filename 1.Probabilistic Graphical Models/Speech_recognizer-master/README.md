# Speech_recognizer
Project for "probabilist graphical model" class

Here is a code to design a speech recognizer with hidden Markov modelling.
Everything is control through the main, with the "opts" matlab structure.
Our work was based on data available at
http://imagine.enpc.fr/~obozinsg/data/speech_data.zip
described in
chenlab.ece.cornell.edu/projects/AudioVisualSpeechProcessing/

It was based on two articles mainly:

[1] A. V. Nefian, L. Liang, X. Pi, X. Liu, and K. Murphy, 
“Dynamic bayesian networks for audio-visual speech recognition,” 
Journal on Applied Signal Processing.

[2] L. R. Rabiner, 
“A tutorial on hidden markov models and selected applications in speech recognition,”
Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 77, no. 2.

The code is too slow to be really presented as final, however this is a good introduction to audio modeling and hidden Markov model.
