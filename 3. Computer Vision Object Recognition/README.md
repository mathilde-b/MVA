Description: This project will explore whether it is possible to automatically recognize Time's Arrow in a temporal sequence -- is it possible to tell whether a video is running forwards or backwards?

The project will proceed along the following steps: 

1. Read and make sure you understand well the method of [1]. 

2. Design and implement a classifier similar to the first method described in the paper “Flow words” but using more recent convolutional neural network descriptors. 

3. Test the method on the dataset of [1].  

4. Following [3] extend the method to spatially localize areas in the image that are most distinctive to recognize the direction of time in the video. 

5. Run the method on your own videos that you either record by your own camera or download from YouTube.
